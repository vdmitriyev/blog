Hurra! I have one platform less to maintain!

Very short story - for no reason wordpress.com blocked my personal blog, which they were hosting for free.

It's nice that since long I moved everything to the github.com repository and started to support my personal blog mainly in markdown and exposing it via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) service. The decision was made after I spent a fair amount of time figuring out list of really demanding for me features on wordpress.com, which were not existing in free version or not existing at all.

All I did in order to be blocked - I tried to synchronize my previously written post [How to export MS Power Point Slides to the PDF file and keep Animations](http://vdmitriyev.github.io/blog/how-to-export-ms-power-point-slides-to-the-pdf-file-and-keep-animations.html) with my wordpress.com blog directly in markdown. And when I started to port another blog article, I figured out that I was blocked. Of course I tried to get in contact with wordpress.com via the form they offered me and report and error. However, I wasn't able to convince them that I'm not a bot, spamer or any other similar entity. One single credit that I would like to give them (besides the fact that they hosted my blog for free), that they really reacted very fast in answering my appeal. I hope that at least the human responded me, not a robot.

Here is the part from their answer telling me what was wrong with the content I provided: *"the Content is not spam, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites"*. The whole emails:

P.S. **Viva la GitHub!**
