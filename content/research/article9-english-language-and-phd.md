There is always a chance that you will be writing your doctoral work, not in your mother language. Another fact is that used by your language most probably will be English. And even if you are not located in an English speaking country, there is always a huge probability that you are going to use English for your writing. Thus, the collection of materials that can be revised from time to time in order to refresh rules of a foreign language is usually a handy tool.

List of articles related to the English language that can be really useful:

* [How to Use Articles (a/an/the)](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/540/01/)
* [Indefinite Article With A Plural Noun](https://www.grammarly.com/handbook/grammar/articles/10/indefinite-article-with-a-plural-noun/)
* [Is there a simple rule for "the" article?](https://www.grammarly.com/answers/questions/48-is-there-a-simple-rule-for-the-article/)
    + See a list with 8 rules
* [Adjectives, Articles and Adverbs](https://students.case.edu/academic/resources/writing/grammar/speech1.html)
* [Which words in a title should be capitalized?](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/14/which-words-in-a-title-should-be-capitalized)
* [Ten common mistakes made by English learners](http://languagelearningbase.com/86372/ten-common-mistakes-made-by-english-learners)

List of useful books:

* [Practical English Usage (by Michael Swan)](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-English-Usage-Michael-Swan/dp/0194420981)

Besides listed above materials for refreshing your language knowledge, there are also a number of online courses that are really helpful. From my side, I strongly recommend taking part in the course [Writing in the Sciences](http://online.stanford.edu/course/writing-sciences-self-paced-spring-2016) provide by Stanford.

Also, as not a native speaker, you may want to use one of the following services:

* [grammarly](https://grammarly.com/)
* [Textly.AI](https://textly.ai/grammar-check)
