This short notice is for the once who would like to learn something new, and this new thing is a Golang. Learning something completely new in tech can be incredibly challenging. There are a couple of major hurdles to overcome. For example:

* No time: Between work, study, personal commitments, and everything else life got for us, finding dedicated time to learn a new skill is challenging
* Dedication: Sticking with a learning path takes focus and perseverance. For instance, a technology could be big and 
* Job: Sometimes, our current job roles don't offer opportunities to apply new skills. This lack of practical application could be demotivating.
* Fun factor: Even with a lot of dedication, some technical subjects can be dry. Without finding a way to make the learning process engaging, it's easy to lose interest.

Let us get back to Go. One can easy get overwhelmed with materials, new concepts, issues, opinions of others and gate keeping. Thus, a structured way of finding out "the right path" is going to be individual. Learning a new programming language could be challenging on its own. Specially, if a language you are learning is no like other onces you had learned and used for a long (or short) time. In may case it hits quite good: despite having experience with "classical compiled languages" like Java, C#, etc. and "classical interpreted languages" like Python, Ruby, etc. it is still not an easy job to master Go.

Here is a path that was followed on the way to learn Go. It could be also called "a learn concept".
