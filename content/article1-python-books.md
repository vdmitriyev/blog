I have an programming experience in various of languages, mainly from the mainstream category like C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, etc. . Despite having a really big variety of programming languages, sometimes you want to stick to particular one. For me it’s currently the [Python](https://www.python.org/).

After I spent some time writing code in Python for various tasks (e.g., data wrangling, statistical computations, machine learning, databases, etc.) I thought that I need advanced or fundamental book (-s), which can help me to bring my **Python Skills** one level up. And as I expected the job of figuring out the best suitable books had to be performed on my own. I even asked people on twitter with almost no [responses](https://twitter.com/vdmitriyev/status/573602586017800193) (thanks to my friend Bota for giving me at least one book as a hint). I invested my some of my time searching on the web (primary on reading amazon recommendations and deciding about trusting or not them) and at the end I formed following list of books for my own, but I thought that also can be handy for others:

* [Python in Practice Create Better Programs Using Concurrency, Libraries, and Patterns](http://www.qtrac.eu/pipbook.html) by Mark Summerfield
* [Effective Python: 59 Specific Ways to Write Better Python](http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/B00TKGY0GU/ref=sib_dp_kd#reader-link)
* [High Performance Python: Practical Performant Programming for Humans](http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Python-Performant-Programming/dp/1449361595/) by Micha Gorelick and Ian Ozsvald
* [Mastering Object-oriented Python by Steven F. Lott](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Object-oriented-Python-Steven-Lott/dp/1783280972/)


Of course there are other compilations of Python books existing. To list a few:

* [What are the best books / courses for learning Python? at AMA service Quora](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-books-courses-for-learning-Python)
